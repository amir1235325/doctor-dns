"""Timing the public resolvers the admin panel offers.

What has to hold: a resolver's time is the median of a few real DNS
questions, and one that does not answer says so; each relay times the list -
plus the operator's own pick - every ten minutes, in a thread of its own,
and again at once when the operator asks; the panel hands the list out and
keeps each relay's figures; the admin panel's card shows them per relay and
for the exit, the fastest in each column marked, and the times beside the
choices. The panel's list and the admin panel's are the same list.
