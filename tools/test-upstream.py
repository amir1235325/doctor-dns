"""Picking the public resolvers: the admin panel's choice, and the relay's.

What has to hold: the admin panel refuses what is not a public address and
what does not answer from the exit, and points the exit's own nginx at the
pick - checked with nginx -t and put back if nginx refuses it. The panel hands
the pick to the relays; a relay takes it only if the first one answers from
there, drops a second that does not, and does not try a failed pick again
every half minute. Every place that asked 1.1.1.1 by name - the bypasses, a
template's resolver, `smartdns bypass`, the exit's nginx - now asks whatever
was picked, and an upgrade does not put the defaults back. epic-pin is the
exception, as it was before: it asks Google on purpose.
