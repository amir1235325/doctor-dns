"""The sync API goes through the tunnel when there is one.

Filtering between Iran and an exit kills a large upload on the direct path
while small ones pass: a customer's receipt timed out every time at 25
seconds, the exit logging a read that never finished, and the same bytes went
through the tunnel untouched. So the relay reaches the API through the tunnel
when it can, and straight to the exit when that end is not up.

Two things have to hold and neither is obvious. Only the way in may be
retried - a request that was already sent may have been acted on, and a second
"add this much quota" is worse than an error. And through the tunnel the
request arrives at the exit from its own loopback, so the relay has to name
itself, or every relay's usage would be counted under one name.
